# Position-values-on-a-map
Data visualisation on a map

First version of py file  : cartepython.py, positions map of Europe, text, name of two towns arrows from one to the other town and text in boxes
Second version of py file : cartepython2.py in progress, tends to upload two files : one with locations (Name, latitude, longitude)
                                                                                     one with activity from a location to the other 
                            possibility to choose two or many locations and visualize activity from all locations to others (arrows, texts...)

Screen copies :
- Plotting from cartepython.py
- imports needed
- error message on my airbus laptop when trying to install basemap.
